# TrackWithSlate

Slate is a fully client-side web application for flexible and personalized management of local tabular data. It allows you to create, edit, and organize records and categories without relying on any external servers or remote databases. All data is saved locally in your browser's storage, ensuring autonomy and privacy. You can download your data and take with you in a CSV file.

## Features

* **Custom columns**: Define columns with custom types such as text, number, date, or toggle (boolean) fields.
* **Record management**: Easily load, edit, and view records associated with your defined columns.
* **Configurable dates**: Use custom date formats, with automatic date completion based on the selected format.
* **Categorization**: Support for categories, including both linked (attached) and standalone categories.
* **Local storage**: Stores all data in the browser’s localStorage, ensuring that your data is kept locally and privately.
* **Bulk operations**: Simple interfaces for bulk editing and for selective or complete deletion of records and categories.
* **Intuitive UI**: Optimized user interface controls like toggle switches, dropdown selectors, confirmation prompts for actions, and dynamic column management.

## Who is it for?

TrackWithSlate is designed for users who need a powerful yet minimalist tool to manage personal data, lists, inventories, or any tabular dataset on their own terms. It is ideal for those who prioritize privacy and local control, and who prefer flexible configurations without the complexity or dependency of cloud-based solutions.

## Technology

* **Frontend**: Built with Vue 3 using modular, reusable components.
* **Persistence**: Uses the browser’s localStorage for data persistence, with no backend server required.
* **Dynamic handling**: Provides dynamic management of date formats, categories, and data fields to fit diverse use cases.

## Status

TrackWithSlate is in active development, focusing on a lean feature set, a clear user experience, and maximum autonomy for the user.
Always back up your data, specially if resetting browser settings or cache. Remember, **your data is only on your browser until you download it**.
