**slate** is a local tool for creating, organizing and exporting csv tabular data directly in your browser.  
No internet connection or installation required â€” just download the html file and it will open as a web page.

Built for people who need a lightweight and local way to manage personal structured data without external dependencies. Ideal for those who prefer simplicity, privacy and control. Not for highly specific professional use but some edge-cases are covered.

All your data stays on your machine without accounts, servers or sync. Just remember to export frequently and before deleting browser data.

* **Autofill categories**: Tag any column as a category to create autofill buttons for every entry under it.
* **Date formats**: Configurable date input with custom format selector and optional autofill with current date.
* **Storage**: Everything is saved in-browser using the built in localstorage and can be easily exported.
* **Field types**: Define columns with custom field types like text, number, date or boolean.
